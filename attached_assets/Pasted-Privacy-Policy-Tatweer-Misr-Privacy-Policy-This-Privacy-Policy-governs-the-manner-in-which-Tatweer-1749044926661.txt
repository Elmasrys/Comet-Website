Third-Party Websites

Users may encounter content within the app linking to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the content or practices of such sites. These external sites have their own privacy policies and terms of use. Interacting with such sites is subject to their respective policies.

Tap Solutions

Our application includes a point collection and refund system designed strictly for internal app use. Users may accumulate points through actions defined within the app. These points may be reversed or refunded within the same environment. Points have no real-world monetary value, cannot be exchanged for goods or services, and are not redeemable outside the app.

The app also includes QR code generation and scanning features to securely transfer point-related data between authorized applications published under our developer account. These QR codes are not used to promote third-party content, offer external rewards, or enable unauthorized data sharing.

A full transaction history related to points is stored and displayed to provide users with a transparent activity log. This data is securely stored and is only accessible within the app for reference and auditing purposes.

We do not sell or share any personal or transactional data with third parties. All point-related features are designed to comply with App Store and Play Store guidelines, as well as standard privacy and security practices.
